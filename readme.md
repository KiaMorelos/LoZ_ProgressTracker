# Legend of Zelda - Progress Tracker & Gaming Reference

## Schema
- A new schema diagram is coming soon.

## Features I still need to add:

- Pagination
- A way to mark games as played
- A place to add items/dungeons to the journal...Though, I think now that maybe the note pad itself is probably a more user friendly solution.
- A place to add a working link to a non-youtube guide, such as a text guide.
- Tests
- Improved Styles
